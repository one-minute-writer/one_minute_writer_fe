## Overview
This is a group project incorporating a new stretch tech, GraphQL. This is also the first time the back-end program and the front-end program were able to collaborate and build a functioning application together. We used agile process to turn our application into deployed and production ready software.

## Joint Learning Goal
Our learning goal was to build this application using a new technology that none of us had previous experience with. We chose GraphQL and TypeScript.

## Group Reflection 
In hindsight, we probably should have done only GraphQL and not implement TypeScript as well. In our research, we learned that graphQL also types our properties, and data that we're passsing. But implementing TypeScript was a great learning experience for all of us, since we aren't completely familiar with TypeScript. 

## Future Enhancements
- Add login page for multiple users experience
- Add larger curated words list for users to have more inspiration words. 
- Add more curated images for user to have more inspiration images. 
- Add a section in the writing page for users to be able to check for synonyms of words.
