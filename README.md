## Overview
One minute writer is for creatives who are seeking inspiration and a space to document and organize their ideas and writing. They can track their progress through metrics on a user dashboard as well as revisit and edit past writings. This is a group project incorporating a new stretch tech, GraphQL. This is also the first time the back-end program and the front-end program were able to collaborate and build a functioning application together. We used agile process to turn our application into deployed and production ready software.

## Joint Learning Goal
Our learning goal was to build this application using a new technology that none of us had previous experience with. We chose GraphQL and TypeScript.

## Group Reflection 
In hindsight, we probably could have done only GraphQL and not implement TypeScript as well. In our research, we learned that graphQL also types our properties, and data that we're passsing. But implementing TypeScript was a great learning experience for all of us and is an extra layer to prevent future bugs or typing errors. 

## Future Enhancements
- Add login page for multiple user experience.
- Add larger curated words list to have more inspiration words. 
- Add a section in the writing page for users to be able to check for synonyms of words. 

## Install and Setup
  1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:one-minute-writer/one_minute_writer_fe.git`
  2. Install the necessary package dependencies `npm install`
  3. Run the command `npm start`
  4. Start the server at `http://localhost:4000/`
